PROJECT INTRODUCTION
Steps to Complete

    Create a View called “forestation” by joining all three tables - forest_area, land_area, and regions in the workspace.
    The forest_area and land_area tables join on both country_code AND year.
    The regions table joins these based on only country_code.
    In the ‘forestation’ View, include the following:
        All of the columns of the origin tables
        A new column that provides the percent of the land area that is designated as forest.
    Keep in mind that the column forest_area_sqkm in the forest_area table and the land_area_sqmi in the land_area table are in different units (square kilometers and square miles, respectively), so an adjustment will need to be made in the calculation you write (1 sq mi = 2.59 sq km).
